            <p>In this section, I'll provide you with a glimpse into my professional journey and the valuable experiences I've gathered along the way. From the early steps in my career to my current role, each opportunity has contributed to my growth and expertise. Join me as I share the highlights of my professional endeavors.</p>
            
            <h2> Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                I am Sulaiman Hashimi, a Functional Manager of OWS (Ortec Workforce Scheduling) through Sogeti at gemeente Amsterdam. I have experience in business analysis from my time at Triple-P. I have experience with Salesforce and a strong affinity for Tosca and Selenium. I have 8 years of experience in various IT roles, including business analyst and system administrator, and hold both an MBO and HBO IT diploma.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                During my Quality Engineering & Testing traineeship, I learned structured testing according to TMAP principles and obtained certifications in Azure, Scrum, and Selenium. I excel in my knowledge of hardware and software, drawing from my experience as a system administrator, allowing me to approach my work as a tester with a broad perspective. At Triple-P, I conducted process analyses, learning to collaborate with business analysts and work methodically. My initial step in any assignment is to gain a helicopter view and then delve into the details. This was essential in my assignment at SMS Microsystems, where I managed 100 applications and needed to switch continuously. By creating smart overviews and planning my work effectively, I achieved success.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My ambition is to work on projects with high complexity, preferably involving Tosca or other automation tools. I thrive in environments where I collaborate closely with end-users and stakeholders.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In my free time, I value a healthy balance by staying active with fitness and spending quality time with friends and family.
