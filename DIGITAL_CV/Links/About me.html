        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p> 
            I'm Sulaiman Hashimi, born on the first of March in Logar, Afghanistan, and migrated to the Netherlands as an infant. In the Netherlands, my family and I moved several times as we experienced economic growth. My passion for computers has been a constant in my life, and my interest in gaming developed later on.

            Before our family had access to the internet and PC games, we owned a large white PC (the model of which I've long forgotten). This PC used the original floppy disks, which, if you're not familiar, resemble the save icon in most modern-day games. I would spend hours immersed in exploring the contents of this magical device.

            My fascination deepened when I gained access to the internet on a more modern PC. The early days of the internet felt like pure magic to me. I enjoyed playing games like RuneScape, MapleStory, Habbo Hotel, Age of Empires, and various Java games online.

            A few years later, I embarked on my journey to become a real IT professional by pursuing an education in MBO - ICT Systeembeheerder. However, I quickly realized that I wanted more from this field. This realization led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in HBO Business IT Management. I completed my education with a thesis project at the company Sogeti, which ultimately paved the way for my current fulfilling job.
